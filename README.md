# monadic-python-demo

An experimental attempt at implementing the essence of a monad while adding Python-specific and practical enhancements.

- `maybe.py` contains the implementation of the `Maybe` class.
- `examples.py` contains example usage.

All the code is heavily commented with lots of examples.
